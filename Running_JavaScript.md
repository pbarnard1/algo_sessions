# Running JavaScript

If you want to run JavaScript code, there are several ways you can accomplish this:

- **[Download and install Node.js here:](https://nodejs.org/en/)**   Make sure Node is added to your PATH; it should do it automatically, but if not, you might have to add it to the PATH yourself.
- **Code Runner:** Code Runner is a handy VS Code extension.  Click on the Extensions icon (with the squares with a loose one) in VS Code, then search for and install Code Runner.  This is handy for running short snippets of code.  NOTE: You likely will need to install Node.js first.  (If you need to run bigger blocks of code, you're likely better off running the file with Node.)
- **Developer tools:** In Chrome, it's Ctrl+Shift+J for Windows, Ctrl+Option+J for Mac, or you can go to the menu, then select "More Tools" -> "Developer tools". You can also use Safari, Firefox or another browser if you wish.
- **[Python Tutor:](http://www.pythontutor.com/visualize.html#mode=edit)** This is a great tool for not only running your code, but visualizing it as well so you can see what each variable is currently holding, along with what's being returned and printed out.  This page sounds like it only runs Python, but you can uses it for Python and other languages too!

There may be other ways to run JavaScript that you find convenient.  If you have any questions or issues, please reach out to any of the TAs or instructors, or even your fellow cohort mates!
