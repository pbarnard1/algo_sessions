// Introduction to JavaScript and algorithms - session 1, January 16, 2021

/* JavaScript is used a lot in web pages.  You can do stuff to the webpage after it loads, 
when you click on a button, etc.  Remember that web pages use HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

An algorithm, often referred to as an algo for short, is a set of instructions that is to be
executed, or run.  For example, you might write an algorithm to run a bunch of simulations to see
how often you get 3 heads out of 5 coin flips 100 times.  You could write one to retrieve and search
for data.  There is no limit to what you can do with algorithms.

For the next four weeks, we will go over the basics of JavaScript and what are called the Basic 13
algos that you have hopefully nail down quickly by the time you graduate from Coding Dojo.

/* Introduction to JavaScript:
Variables:
- MUST start with a letter
- Typically written in camelCase (first word not capitalized, each word thereafter capitalized)
- Can also contain numbers, underscores (_) and dollar signs ($)
- Cannot use keywords (e.g. "if", "else", "do", "while", "for")
- Case sensitive (so "M" is different from "m")

Data types:
- Numbers (2, -5, 2.4, 2e6 [2 million])
- Strings (3 ways to write them), also concatenate (i.e. put them together)
- Boolean types (true, false)
- Basic operations (+, -, *, /, % [modulo])
- Casting data types ("3"+5 vs 3+"5" vs 3+5)

Logical operators:
- >, <, >=, <=, ==, !=, &&, ||, "!" (not operator) - also === and !== (won't go over in too much detail)

Printing values:
- console.log()

Functions:
- Can accept any number of arguments
- Can return values

// Commenting code: done two ways
// "//" is for commenting code for that line only
/* This is 
a block comment, where
code is ignored between the two pairs
of symbols */

// For loops
// Incrementing and decrementing (++, --, +=, -=)

// To do: all of the above, then the first 2 of the basic 13 algos - algos 3-6 next week, when we go over arrays
// Demonstrate T diagrams
// Show a few ways to run code
// Take it nice and slow - you'll get the hang of this soon enough!  Be patient, and don't be afraid to ask!
// Have Q&A session at end to open up for questions

// Handy references:
// W3, Mozilla, Python Tutor, Eloquent JavaScript, many others as well

// Basic Algo #1: Print 1-255
// Print all the integers from 1 to 255.

// Basic Algo #2: Print Sum 0-255
// Print integers from 0 to 255, and with each integer print the sum so far.
