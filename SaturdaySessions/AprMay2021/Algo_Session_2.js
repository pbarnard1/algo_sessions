/*
Review for loops and incrementing briefly

Go over nested for loops (from Carl Wright II)
If statements and things like ">", "<", etc.
- >, <, >=, <=, ==, !=, &&, ||, "!" (not operator) - also === and !== (won't go over in too much detail)

// 3 === 3 // true
// 3 === "3" // false

If statements:
If-else if-else clauses - write a few demos

Logical operators:
- >, <, >=, <=, ==, !=, &&, ||, "!" (not operator) - also === and !== (won't go over in too much detail)

Arrays:
.length property
Common methods: .pop(), .push()

// Basic Algo #3: Find and Print Max
// Given an array, find and print its largest element.

// Basic Algo #4: Array with Odds
// Create an array with all the odd integers between 1 and 255 (inclusive).

// Basic Algo #5: Greater Than Y
// Given an array and a value Y, count and print the number of array values greater than Y.

// Basic Algo #6: Max, Min, Average
// Given an array, print the max, min and average values for that array.
